# Primitives

Primitives are basic types, similar to classes but they have no constructor or methods. 
They have special ways to define each of them.

## Primitive Types

| Type           | Syntax  |
|----------------|---------|
| Integer        | `int`   |
| Floating Point | `float` |
| Boolean        | `bool`  |
