# Hello World!

Now that youâ€™ve installed Lesma, we can start writing our first Lesma program! You can use either a terminal or an editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create the folder and the files in this tutorial.

## Writing a Lesma Program

Make a new source file called `main.les`. All Lesma files will have the extension `.les`. If you're using a multi-word filename, you can split it with an _underscore_, like `hello_world.les` instead of `helloworld.les`.

:::danger
String and built-in functions (like print) are not currently implemented!
:::

```py
print("Hello World!")
```

## Running The Program

To be able to use Lesma you need to either refer to the binary file we created in the [Getting Started](getting-started) section, or add the folder to the PATH environment variable.

```bash
lesma run main.les
```

It should print `Hello World!` in the console. If it did, congrats, you wrote your first Lesma program.
